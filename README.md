# Kaprekar_const_3digit
The Kaprekar constant for 3-digit numbers is either 495 or 6174, depending on the base in which the numbers are represented.

To find the Kaprekar constant for base 10, we start with any 3-digit number that has at least two distinct digits. We then arrange the digits in descending order to form the largest possible number, and in ascending order to form the smallest possible number. We subtract the smallest number from the largest number, and repeat this process with the result until we reach the Kaprekar constant.
